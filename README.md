## **üéØ Project Highlights**

**Example:**

* Built a ResNet model using techniques such as data augmentation, class weighting, weighted random sampling, and gradient accumulation to solve the Equitable AI for Dermatology Kaggle Competition.
* Achieved an F1 score of .4775 and a ranking of 20th on the final Kaggle Leaderboard
* We utilized the classification_report from sklearn to provide detailed insights into the model‚Äôs performance. This report displays the precision, recall and F1-score for each class label, enabling us to understand how well the model performed in classifying different skin condition categories. This helped with the interpretation of model decisions and to identify potential areas for improvement.
* To optimize results within compute constraints we used gradient accumulation, updating model weights every 2 batches, to effectively increase batch size. We also used weighted random sampling to counter the issue of imbalance data. This helped ensure the model was not overtrained on larger classes within the dataset.

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

Equitable AI for Dermatology

 We now live in a world where AI governs access to information, opportunity and freedom. However, AI systems can perpetuate racism, sexism, ableism, and other harmful forms of discrimination, therefore, presenting significant threats to our society - from healthcare, to economic opportunity, to our criminal justice system.

The Algorithmic Justice League is an organization that combines art and research to illuminate the social implications and harms of artificial intelligence.

AJL‚Äôs mission is to raise public awareness about the impacts of AI, equip advocates with resources to bolster campaigns, build the voice and choice of the most impacted communities, and galvanize researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to prevent AI harms.

AI is transforming healthcare, yet dermatology AI tools often underperform for people with darker skin tones due to a lack of diverse training data. This can lead to diagnostic errors, delayed treatments, and health disparities for underserved communities.

This challenge from Break Through Tech and the Algorithmic Justice League invites you to help address this issue by building an inclusive machine learning model for dermatology.

## **üìä Data Exploration**
Dataset

* This dataset is a 4,500-image subset of FitzPatrick17k, which labels dermatological conditions across skin tones using the FitzPatrick Skin Type (FST) scale. It includes 21 conditions from the full set of 100+, balancing a manageable classification task with key representation challenges.

Data exploration and preprocessing approaches

* We explored the data by visualizing any class imbalances and missing values, which informed our data preprocessing approach. There were no missing values except in the ‚Äòqc‚Äô column (around 97% were null values), which was handled by removing the column. In terms of class distribution, squamous cell carcinoma was the most represented in our dataset, while basal cell carcinoma morpheiform was the least common. Overall, there is a class imbalance in our distribution, which could cause bias in our model training. Some approaches to tackle this issue are sampling more of the minority classes, or adding weights to them during training.

Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset

* One challenge was that it was the first time working with image classification for many of us, so understanding image data was one of the first steps we had to take. Another challenge was addressing class imbalance within the data, which would affect our model training and results. During this process, another one of our goals was to be able to train a model that could predict well on varying skin types. This proved to be a challenge as we evaluated our model, so we had to tune our model for accuracy and bias.

Here is a visualization of the class distribution of the dataset:

## **üß† Model Development**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used: ResNet 50 (CNN) with transfer learning to leverage pre-trained weights for improved performance. 
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies: Used images provided and pre-processed them (resized, normalization, and data augmentation). Implemented a learning rate scheduler to adapt during training. Also used the AdamW optimizer for better regularization. 
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance): Used provided training data sets to train the model with a batch size of 32. Utilized 50 epochs.

* How your model performed overall: Our overall model accuracy was 92.24%, with an average precision score of .93, recall score of .97, and f1 score of .92 across the different skin conditions.
* Currently working on improving our preformance. 

**NEED TO FILL**
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)

## **üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements**

**Address the following:**

* What are some of the limitations of your model?
Limitations could include the reliance of the single pre-trained model used. Also, even using class weights, the model‚Äôs performance is heavily dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data we were provided. 

* What would you do differently with more time/resources?
If we had better processes, we would adjust the model parameters (such as increasing the number of epochs) and/or increase the amount of data processed to improve predictions. We would like to explore more model options in order to improve prediction. Have a better understanding of how different skin types affect the prediction. 



* What additional datasets or techniques would you explore? TODO
